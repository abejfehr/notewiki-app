# Welcome to NoteWiki!

This is a notetaking app that's been designed to let you make your notes like Wikipedia articles, so you can separate concepts and avoid having them in one giant document, but still be able to access them easily.

## How to Use
To begin making pages, simply:

1. Create a link to a page you'd like to create
2. Follow it
3. Edit that page to include some content
4. Save it!

For example, [this is a link to a page that has not yet been created](Puppies). If you follow it, you'll be brought to an entirely empty page that doesn't yet contain any content. You can edit it and write whatever you want.

> <cite>Elon Musk</cite>

## How do I format pages?
I've made this page as a bit of an example so you can see various concepts at work. It has links to other pages (both internal and external), images, quotes, and lists.
